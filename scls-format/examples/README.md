Example files that are used for basic prototyping, manual testing
and checking sanity of the interfaces.

Current programs are expected to be removed by the version 1.0
and replaced by the proper test-suites and tools.

List of the programs:
  - [example-write-file](./write-file) â€” generate a file from arbitrary data
  - [example-read-file](./read-file) - reads a file and shows it's structure
  - [example-extract-by-ns](./extract-by-ns/) - extracts raw data for each namespace in a separate file
