Reads SCLS file with an arbitrary data inside, outputs structure of blocks

Usage:

```
cabal run example-read-file file.scls
```

This file is used to check interface for reading and faster manual testing
and prototyping of the new blocks.

This file is expected to be removed after we stabilize interface for reading
files and introduce a test suite.
